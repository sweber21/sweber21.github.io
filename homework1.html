<h1>Homework 1</h1>
<h3>Response to Chapter 1 of <I>The Pragmatic Programmer</I></h3>

<p>I thought the most interesting part of the reading was the section on "Good-Enough Software." In academics, it has been ingrained in us that we should always strive to perform to the best of our ability, however in the real world this is not always feasible. As the reading points out, this is especially the case in programing - deadlines and constantly evolving consumer expectations dictate that we must publish programs even when improvements are still possible. </p>

<p> I think it can be difficult for programers to know when they have reached a good "stopping point" and should begin using their software (or send it off to their users). If they publish their work too early, their software may not sufficiently solve the problem they set out to solve. On the flip side, if they publish too late, the requirements could have changed and thus render their work irrelevant. This is going to present a very significant challenge for inexperienced programers like ourselves. <p/>

<p> This chapter also provided me with some insight as to why software developers create programs with defects that seem somewhat simple and avoidable (Ex: why Apple comes out with a new software update with bug fixes at least once a month). Yes, it is annoying when we encounter those glitches that we do not expect, however if the programmers took the time to work out every single bug possible before publishing their software, we would still all be operating with outdated and overall inferior programs, even when you take into account the annoying errors in the new ones. I hope we can keep this principle in mind, as well as all of the other ones mentioned in this chapter, as we progress through this class. </p>
