<p>The part of GitHub that I feel I understand the least is the general organization and relationship between repositories, projects, and files. When I make a new commit, I understand that it is saved in GitHub somewhere, but I'm not really sure how/why it is saved where it is. I feel as though I need to understand the structure of where I am saving these files before I can appreciate GitHub's usefulness. </p>
